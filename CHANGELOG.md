- `Docs`: README, user guides, generated API docs, or other documentation-only changes.
- `Samples`: Examples, sample flows, sample scripts, or sample applications.
- `Tests`: Test suites, test fixtures, golden vectors, or verification data.
- `Tooling`: Developer/operator command-line tools and helper utilities.
- `CI`: Release checks, workflow scripts, or automation-only changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Samples: Restore only confirmed test writes in reverse order; preserve outcome-unknown failures without further writes.
- Tests: Exercise sample cleanup after rejected writes, readback failures, and uncertain write or restoration outcomes.
- Docs: Add the missing `SlmpTarget` import to the block-read example and correct the named-write docstring.
- Samples: Keep bit-in-word operations out of the single-request named-write example.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-09-03

- Release: Bumped package metadata and `slmp.__version__` to `5.2.0` for the approved high-level API overhaul.
- Docs: Corrected qualified CPU-buffer notation: CPU buffer memory uses `U3En\G` and CPU periodic buffer memory uses only `U3En\HG` with `n` from `0` through `3`; `Un\HG` is not a valid general module form.
- BREAKING: Removed the 20 sync/async public Memory and Extend Unit client callables, with no compatibility aliases or replacement public wrappers. Removed the obsolete `slmp-open-items-recheck` console entry, implementation function, and dedicated launcher; maintained internal tooling uses private codecs where still required.
- Library: Added canonical `_extended` names for the six sync/async Extended Device method families. The old `_ext` names remain temporary direct delegates with identical validation, errors, result, command, and wire behavior.
- Library: Added top-level `plc_profile_display_name`; the old top-level `display_name` remains a temporary direct delegate, while `SlmpPlcProfileDescriptor.display_name` is unchanged.
- Library: Deprecated top-level `read_dwords` and `read_dwords_sync` for one compatibility release. They warn and directly delegate to the canonical single-request helpers; the client methods remain unchanged, and the top-level compatibility names are scheduled for removal in the immediately following release.
- Library: Added sync/async `read_latest_self_diagnosis_error_code()`, which returns the raw unsigned word from one Direct Read of `SD0` without retry, fallback, classification, or writes.
- BREAKING: Fixed the existing `DeviceRef` / `parse_device` surface as the profile-bound DeviceAddress API and `SlmpAddress` / `parse_address` / `format_address` / `normalize_address` as the AddressSpec API. `normalize_address` no longer accepts a `DeviceRef`; typed expressions and qualified routes are not accepted as direct devices, plain devices are not accepted as AddressSpec values, and no duplicate naming API was added.
- Tests: Added public-surface removal, canonical/legacy delegate, warning, profile-display, sync/async parity, and exact SD0 Direct Read coverage.
- Tooling: Fixed the isolated wheel smoke check so the release workflow's repository `PYTHONPATH` cannot cause a generated local egg-info directory to be mistaken for an installed wheel.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-08-27

- Release: Bumped package metadata and `slmp.__version__` to `5.1.0` for the additive high-level API and profile-limit release.
- Library: Added the typed public `profile_limit` lookup, `SlmpProfileLimitKey`, and `SlmpProfileLimit`, exposing operational point and weighted limits from the same canonical capability table used by request validation.
- Library: Added canonical async/sync `read_bits_single_request` and `write_bits_single_request` helpers. Existing `read_bits*` / `write_bits*` and short `read_words*` names remain deprecated one-release delegates to their canonical single-request helpers.
- Library: Restored canonical Q-series device-range runtime discovery for QCPU, LCPU, QnU, and QnUDV base/unit profiles. QCPU probes Z15, all affected profiles discover ZR by capped doubling and binary search, and R is derived as `min(ZR, 32768)`.
- Library: Runtime candidate reads classify every nonzero PLC end code as unreadable while preserving timeout, cancellation, transport, lifecycle, protocol, and local-validation failures; the complete SD/probe acquisition owns one FIFO turn and never returns a partial catalog.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-08-07

- Library: Named polling now prepares and validates its immutable Random Read payload and compact decode indexes once per stream, then reuses them for every FIFO-controlled cycle without changing timing, cancellation, close, or error behavior.
- Library: Typed command decoders now parse a private `memoryview` over the owned response frame; public raw/trace/error and byte-result surfaces still expose owned `bytes`. Extended Random and Monitor builders now use a validated exact-size two-pass encoder with one final payload allocation and no per-device encoded buffers.
- Tests: Added allocation/encoding counters and regressions for one-time polling preparation, compact indexed decode, typed/raw response ownership, and exact-size Extended payload construction.
- Docs: Made typed, bit-in-word, extended-device, link-direct, packed-bit, password-lock, monitor-registration, and Clear Error examples explicit controlled-test operations; confirmed writes now attempt to restore saved values before propagating readback failures, while outcome-unknown state changes require manual reconciliation.
- Tests: Added getting-started/usage fence compilation and confirmed-write cleanup checks for the state-changing examples.
- BREAKING: A present SLMP PLC error-information prefix must match the active request route, command, and subcommand. Mismatches are malformed responses, retire the transport, and become outcome-unknown for possibly applied state changes; trailing PLC error detail remains preserved.
- BREAKING: Python now rejects every 4E response whose reserved field is not `0x0000`, consistently across sync/async TCP/UDP paths.
- BREAKING: Standard semantic write, monitor-registration, remote-control, password, memory, label, and other ACK-only APIs now require empty success data. A non-empty success ACK retires the transport and raises `SlmpOutcomeUnknownError(PROTOCOL)`; `raw_command()` continues to return arbitrary success data.
- Tests: Added 3E/4E sync/async TCP/UDP error-information correlation, non-empty ACK, raw-command escape-hatch, and 4E reserved-field regressions.
- BREAKING: Device operations now reject a request whose complete consumed span exceeds the selected Q/L 24-bit or iQ-R 32-bit device-number field. This covers contiguous Direct and Extended Device access, Random/Monitor DWord entries, and Block ranges. Packed word access consumes 16 bit-device addresses per word, DWord/float32 consumes two words, Block bit points consume 16 bit devices, native Random/Monitor DWords consume one logical device, and LTN/LSTN current blocks consume one logical device per four transferred words. Random-write overlap checks use the same route widths. Rejection occurs before framing, connection, or traffic accounting.
- BREAKING: `Jn\...` Extended Device text now accepts ASCII decimal digits only for the network number. Fullwidth, Arabic-Indic, and other Unicode digits are rejected before request construction.
- Library: The async maintainer trace hook is now called exactly once and its returned object is awaited when awaitable, including callable objects with `async def __call__`; synchronous and awaited hook failures remain diagnostic-only.
- Tests: Added Q/L and iQ-R read/write span boundaries, DWord/float32 consumed-width vectors, zero-activity sync/async rejection checks, ASCII-only J-network parsing, and sync/async/callable-object trace-hook coverage.
- BREAKING: `read_named`, `read_named_sync`, and `poll` now execute exactly one canonical Random Read or reject the complete plan before transport. Oversized plans, unsupported routes, and long-timer Direct Read families must be split into explicit application calls.
- BREAKING: Semantic bit-unit and bit-entry APIs now require bit devices, Block word entries require word devices, and typed/named dtypes must match the canonical device unit. Use explicit low-level word-unit direct APIs for intentional packed word access to bit-device ranges, and `.n`/`write_bit_in_word` for one bit inside a word device.
- Library: A completely correlated and command-decoded read result, acknowledged write, or framed PLC end-code now remains definitive if local `close()` occurs afterward. Close before read decoding remains `SlmpClosedError`; a possibly-sent state change without a definitive response remains `SlmpOutcomeUnknownError(CLOSED)`.
- Library: Sync and async TCP/UDP exchange cleanup now raises the replacement `SlmpClosedError` after local close instead of accidentally re-raising the originally caught OS or transport exception.
- Tests: Added deterministic sync/async TCP/UDP completion barriers, command-decoder error races, framed PLC-error and acknowledged-write races, local-close exception identity coverage, exhaustive canonical device-unit checks, strict semantic-surface checks, and one-request named-plan vectors.
- Library: Sync and async `raw_command()` now classify unknown commands as state-changing by default. Maintainers may explicitly mark a known or vendor-specific read-only command with `state_changing=False`, but cannot downgrade a known state-changing command; unconfirmed post-send failures remain outcome-unknown.
- Library: Async UDP now retains only the one response future for the active request. Unsolicited, foreign-route, wrong-serial, duplicate, and post-completion datagrams are discarded without an application-level receive queue.
- Library: Sync and async TCP/UDP connection establishment now shares one absolute operation deadline from IPv4 resolution through socket configuration and client adoption. IPv4 literals bypass DNS, lazy connection consumes the request's existing deadline, and late resolver/socket results are never adopted.
- Tests: Added Raw-command safety-override, async UDP single-waiter/discard, delayed-resolution, cumulative connection-deadline, and late-result cleanup coverage.
- CI: The package gate now installs the real wheel into an isolated virtual environment with checkout and `PYTHONPATH` imports disabled, runs public API/RMW assertions from a generated UTF-8 Python file, and rejects root maintainer/runner files, credentials, caches, and build/release output from wheel and sdist inventories.
- Tooling: The source-archive gate can synthesize a Git tree from the complete current worktree, including modified, untracked, and deleted paths, then runs both the full extracted-source gate and installed-wheel consumer gate.
- BREAKING: Removed `QueuedAsyncSlmpClient`; ordinary sync and async clients now own the FIFO operation queue, and `open_and_connect` returns `AsyncSlmpClient` directly.
- BREAKING: Local close, not-connected state, transport failure, request timeout, and possibly-applied state changes now have distinct public exception types. `SlmpOutcomeUnknownError` carries a machine-readable reason and original cause; callers must verify state instead of blindly retrying.
- Library: `close()` rejects the active and queued transport generation. Async cancellation while queued removes the operation without sending, and request deadlines begin only after FIFO activation.
- Library: `read_named` and `poll` validate the complete plan and issue one Random Read or reject before transport. Multi-request aggregates remain explicit application operations.
- Library: `write_bit_in_word` now validates and binds the complete operation before FIFO admission and holds one ordinary-client turn across its read and write. It remains a two-request, non-atomic PLC operation, never retries automatically, and reports possibly-sent writes through `SlmpOutcomeUnknownError`.
- Docs: Clarified the dedicated closed, not-connected, transport, timeout, and outcome-unknown errors. FIFO wait is outside the request deadline; one absolute deadline covers first send through decode, and timeout retires the transport generation.
- Tests: Added FIFO, queued cancellation, close-generation, outcome-unknown, aggregate boundary, input-order, and non-interleaving contract coverage.

- Release: Aligned artifact roles so the registry package contains consumer runtime, native API metadata, license, README, and ecosystem-native examples where applicable while excluding repository tests and maintainer tooling; the GitHub source archive retains tracked non-hardware validation and maintainer inputs.
- Library: Audited every live API that accepts a profile-bound `DeviceRef`: its exact canonical profile, including unit-specific profiles, must equal the client profile before request construction, counters, trace state, serial allocation, or transport activity.
- Tests: Profile-mismatch coverage verifies pre-transport rejection for sync and async paths without reducing unit profiles to their base family.
- Docs: README documentation links now include the shared Performance and Choosing a Language pages, and package registry metadata was expanded for discoverability. No functional change.

### BREAKING

- Library: Sync and async `write_bit_in_word` now cover Direct and qualified U module-buffer / J link-direct complete-word routes, prevalidate the immutable route, own one FIFO turn, and use one absolute post-admission deadline for the mandatory read followed by write. The write is sent even when the bit is unchanged; the pair is not PLC-atomic, never retries, and a possibly transmitted unconfirmed write uses the outcome-unknown error contract.
- Library: Every individual bit-write API now accepts native `bool` values only. Integers including `0` and `1`, strings, bytes, `None`, and truthy objects are rejected before request construction or transport; applications must convert their data explicitly.
- Library: Device-range catalog reads no longer probe candidate addresses or infer a smaller range from PLC errors. Catalogs use only canonical fixed rules and the selected profile's SD-register block, and acquisition errors propagate to the caller.
- Library: Sync and async TCP/UDP connections are now IPv4-only. IPv6 literals are rejected before socket creation, hostnames use the first IPv4 resolver result, and callers using IPv6 must migrate to IPv4.
- Library: Array label lengths now use the SLMP bit/byte logical-length contract and two-byte wire padding. Zero logical lengths, non-exact array write buffers, and zero or odd random-label write buffers are rejected before transport.
- Library: Sync and async requests that exceed the 16-bit SLMP data-length field or one complete UDP datagram are rejected before transport and before 4E serial allocation. Oversized label aggregates now fail deterministically.
- Library: Semantic device-read helpers no longer decode nonzero-end-code responses when `raise_on_error=False`, and malformed packed-bit payloads that were previously tolerated now raise `SlmpError`.

### Fixed

- Library: Sync and async array label reads now accept the documented six-bit/two-byte response shape and reject count, unit, logical-length, truncation, and trailing-data mismatches. Random label reads reject zero or odd result lengths while preserving unknown data type IDs and spare values.
- Library: Enforced command-payload limits of 65,529 bytes over TCP, 65,492 bytes for UDP 3E, and 65,488 bytes for UDP 4E without truncation or automatic splitting.
- Library: Semantic device reads now reject nonzero PLC end codes before decoding payload data, even when the low-level client is configured with `raise_on_error=False`.
- Library: Bit reads now require the exact packed-byte count and reject every used nibble other than `0` or `1`.
- Library: Sync and async send-only operations, including Remote RESET, now clear and close their transport in failure paths as well as after successful transmission.

### Tests

- Tests: Added sync, async, direct, extended, random, typed, named, and codec coverage for Boolean-only individual bit writes, including pre-transport rejection of integer `0` and `1`.
- Tests: Device-range catalog coverage now proves that exactly one canonical SD-register read is used and no runtime address probing occurs.
- Tests: Added IPv6-literal rejection, IPv4 resolver ordering, and sync/async TCP/UDP endpoint-selection coverage.
- Tests: Added bit and byte boundary vectors, pre-transport validation checks, and malformed label-response coverage.
- Tests: Added sync/async transport boundaries, no-serial/no-trace/no-stat rejection checks, and aggregate limits for all four label builders.
- Tests: Added regressions for error-response decode ordering, trailing and non-binary packed-bit data, and sync/async Remote RESET send failures.

## [4.0.1] - 2026-07-29

- Release: Bumped package metadata and `slmp.__version__` to `4.0.1`.
- Release: GitHub Release drafts now prepend this version's changelog section to generated notes and repair a missing section on workflow reruns.

### BREAKING

- Library: Addresses that exceed legacy or link-direct wire fields are now rejected rather than silently truncated.

### Fixed

- Library: Async TCP and UDP connection establishment now shares one client-lock ownership period with send/receive or send-only processing. Concurrent `close()` can no longer clear transport state between `connect()` and exchange startup, and public calls report `ConnectionError` instead of leaking internal `AssertionError` or `None`-state failures.
- Library: J link-direct extended random read/write and monitor registration now use Q/L subcommands and Q/L bit-value encoding; requests that mix J and iQ-R entry layouts are rejected before transport, and typed random writes route LZ and floating-point values through dword entries.
- Library: Range-probe timeouts retain their timeout classification, and profile device-range upper bounds no longer reject transport sends.

### Tests

- Tests: Added deterministic TCP request/response, UDP request/response, and TCP send-only races against `close()`.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-17

- Release: Bumped package metadata and `slmp.__version__` to `4.0.0`.

### BREAKING

- Library: Request-exchange deadline expiry now raises the public `SlmpTimeoutError` subclass of `SlmpError`. The synchronous client no longer exposes the socket's `TimeoutError`, and asynchronous callers that compare exact exception types must accept the new subtype.
- Library: A response is accepted only when its complete route and, for 4E, serial match the request. Discarded foreign responses and split TCP reads now consume one request deadline instead of receiving a fresh timeout budget.

### Added

- Library: Added immutable lifetime traffic snapshots through `traffic_stats()` on synchronous, asynchronous, and queued clients.
- Library: Added the `melsec:mx-r:rj71en71` connection profile with MX-R address rules and canonical live capability data.

### Fixed

- Library: Require every accepted 3E/4E TCP/UDP response to match all four request route fields, and require 4E responses to match both route and serial. Valid foreign responses are discarded within the same request deadline; malformed frames invalidate the transport.
- Library: Apply one absolute deadline to send and complete response assembly. Foreign-route and wrong-serial traffic, including split TCP headers and bodies, can no longer restart or extend the deadline.

### Tests

- Tests: Added deterministic sync/async TCP/UDP correlation matrices for every route field, delayed matching responses, wrong-serial and foreign-route floods, malformed frames, split TCP deadline boundaries, and cancellation ownership.
- Tests: Added direct MX-R RJ71EN71 catalog, base-profile, connection-option, and sample-selector coverage.

### Tooling

- Tooling: Refreshed canonical SLMP profile fixtures for 2026-07-14, including `melsec:mx-r:rj71en71` and its device-range rules.
- Tooling: Updated the canonical profile import default from `v2.0.0` to `v2.1.0` so drift checks reproduce the checked-in fixtures.

### CI

- CI: Invoke pytest through `python -m pytest` in both local and GitHub gates so project-root imports and pytest-only tests behave consistently across platforms.
- CI: Corrected tagged-source import paths across every release-workflow version check.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-13

- Library: Added fixed semantic `clear_error` APIs to sync and async clients.
- Library: Monitor cycle expected counts must total at least one and stay within the selected profile's monitor-registration limit.
- Library: Self-test loopback now rejects declared-length, actual-length, trailing-data, and echo mismatches instead of returning unverified response bytes.
- Docs: Clarified explicit monitor counts and that `U3En\HG` never changes or retries the user-selected request target.

- Tests: Removed vendored cross-repository vector JSON and its dedicated runners. Cross-implementation comparison is executed independently of this library repository.

### BREAKING
- Library: Extended random-read result keys now retain the complete qualified route and typed modifier, preventing values from different CPUs, units, or networks from overwriting each other. Applications must migrate qualified-result lookups such as `HG0` to `U3E0\HG0`; ordinary random-read output keys retain their existing spelling.
- Library: Ordinary and Extended Device random reads now reject duplicate wire targets and overlapping Word/DWord targets before transport. Ordinary result-key spelling is unchanged, but previously accepted duplicate input lists must be corrected.
- Library: Removed `CpuModule` and all `cpu_buffer_*` aliases. Live R120PCPU cross-writes proved that Extend Unit `0x0601/0x1601` and qualified `U3E0\HG` access different physical areas. Use `extend_unit_*` for Extend Unit commands and `read_devices_ext`/`write_devices_ext` with a qualified `U3En\HG` address for HG.
- Library: `read_named` and `poll` now accept only one random-readable named batch, and reject routes that would require hidden follow-up requests. `write_named` likewise emits one random-write request or rejects the complete update set before transport.

- Tooling: Removed legacy library-local discovery, monitor, mixed-block split,
  and raw live-validation scripts that depended on APIs removed by the quality
  overhaul. Canonical live evidence collection now belongs to the profile
  repository and its profile-JSON-driven probe.
- Library: Made connection `port`, `transport`, canonical `plc_profile`, and all four `SlmpTarget` route fields explicit requirements. Missing or invalid values now fail before transport.
- Library: Removed request-level `series` overrides from normal device, remote-password, and long-device APIs. Wire format is derived only from the connection PLC profile.
- Library: Removed the public low-level `request()` method and caller-selected 4E serial numbers. `raw_command(command, subcommand, payload)` remains the single maintainer raw entry point and allocates serials internally.
- Library: Removed command-specific raw-payload wrappers and public label payload builder/parser methods. Use the semantic typed APIs, or the single maintainer `raw_command` entry point for investigation.
- Library: Removed public chunked read/write helpers and mixed-block request splitting. One standard API call now produces one protocol request and rejects profile-limit overflow before transport.
- Library: Made generic device access unit (`bit_unit`), remote run/pause modes, and long-timer head/count values explicit where their omission could select a different operation or address. Direct and Extended Device generic APIs reject every non-Boolean unit value before framing instead of treating false-like values as word access.
- Library: Long-timer and long-retentive-timer helpers now reject non-integer heads/counts, negative or 32-bit-overflow heads, zero counts, and counts above the one-request direct-word limit before transport in both sync and async clients.
- Library: Replaced public raw Extended Device field controls with qualified addresses and typed `SlmpExtendedDevice` modifiers.
- Library: Removed public error-code message/language lookup and public trace/strict-profile controls; structured end codes remain available without embedding manual wording.
- Library: Profile feature errors no longer append an internal bypass hint placeholder or the literal text `None`; normal error text reports only the profile, feature state, and available evidence.
- Library: `raise_on_error` now accepts only actual Booleans in connection options, sync/async clients, and internal request overrides. Omission remains `True`; strings, numbers, null, and containers cannot silently change PLC end-code handling. Each request snapshots the effective policy before waiting or transport, so later mutation cannot change an in-flight response decision.
- Library: The maintainer-only trace callback remains disabled by omission and now rejects non-callable values during sync/async client construction.
- Library: `write_named` now emits exactly one protocol request. It batches compatible word/DWord or bit entries, rejects mixed command families, and rejects hidden bit-in-word read-modify-write; callers must use `write_bit_in_word` explicitly for that two-request operation.
- Library: Typed and generic write APIs now reject strings, fractional integers, Boolean-as-numeric values, truthy bit values, and out-of-range integers before transport instead of converting, masking, wrapping, or saturating them.

### Added
- Library: Added `SlmpPlcProfileDescriptor` and `plc_profile_descriptors()` for canonical SLMP profile metadata.

### Changed
- Library: Random read keeps the unused word or DWord category optional, rejects all-empty or invalid supplied collections before transport, and returns an explicit empty mapping for the unused result category.
- Library: Random word write keeps the unused word or DWord value category optional while rejecting all-empty, malformed, duplicate, overlapping, or invalid value collections before transport; random bit write remains a separate required-input API.
- Library: Block read/write keeps the unused word or bit block category optional, rejects all-empty or malformed inputs before transport, returns an explicit empty list for the unused read category, and rejects overlapping write ranges.
- Library: Request-level monitoring timer omission inherits the validated connection value, explicit zero is preserved, and sync/async overrides now reject Booleans, non-integers, and values outside `0..65535` before framing.
- Library: Standardized communication timeout omission to 3 seconds, monitoring timer omission to 4 seconds (`0x0010`), and TCP keepalive idle to 30 seconds.
- Library: TCP connection setup now fails closed when required keepalive configuration cannot be applied. Sync sockets and async writers are closed before the failure is returned, and no partially configured connection is retained.
- Tooling: Standardized every communicating CLI `--timeout` omission to 3 seconds; read-soak, mixed-load, and TCP-concurrency tools no longer select 5 seconds when the option is absent.
- Library: Reset UDP transport state after timeout/cancellation so a delayed 3E response cannot be accepted by a later request.
- Library: Close TCP or UDP transport after the send-only remote reset request, and close a UDP socket generation after any receive timeout or error, so residual 3E responses cannot be assigned to a later request.
- Library: Empty named read/write/poll inputs are rejected, LZ modifiers accept only index 0 or 1, write-block error policy is snapshotted before transport, and the internal Q/L evidence CLI explicitly uses the maintainer profile bypass.
- Tooling: Required explicit port and transport for every bundled CLI command that communicates with a PLC.
- Tooling: The internal CLI probe client signature now also requires `transport`; direct internal construction can no longer infer TCP even when a command wrapper is bypassed.
- Tooling: The internal CLI probe client now requires a complete `default_target`, and every communicating CLI plus the shared sample parser requires explicit `--network`, `--station`, `--module-io`, and `--multidrop` values instead of constructing an own-station route from omission.
- Tooling: The optional live step in the regression-suite command now requires and forwards a complete route through `--live-network`, `--live-station`, `--live-module-io`, and `--live-multidrop`.
- Samples: Required explicit port and transport and bound address parsing/formatting to the selected PLC profile.
- Samples: Removed the last asynchronous sample fallback that supplied `192.168.250.100:1025`; every target must now be written as an explicit `HOST:PORT` pair.

- Release: Bumped package metadata and `slmp.__version__` to `3.1.0`.
- Tooling: Pinned canonical SLMP profile imports to published profile tag `v2.0.0`.
- Docs: Corrected the current wheel and source-distribution names in release guidance and removed hand-maintained page navigation from `GETTING_STARTED.md`.

### Fixed
- CI: Required an existing exact release tag checkout and matching tag, `pyproject.toml`, runtime, filename, and package metadata before GitHub Release upload.
- CI: Removed the broken generic PyInstaller executable gate; supported CLI tools remain wheel console entry points and built distributions are now inspected before upload.

### Tests
- Tests: Added sync/async contract tests for removed overrides, internal serial allocation, required parameters, profile-derived wire shapes, timeout validation, UDP reset behavior, and public-surface removal.
- Tests: Added a source-level invariant requiring every communicating CLI and shared sample monitoring-timer default to remain `0x0010` (four seconds).
- Tests: Added sync and async regressions proving keepalive setup failure closes the new transport and leaves the client disconnected.
- Tests: Added sync and async regressions proving the maintainer raw command cannot omit its keyword-only subcommand or payload and reaches no transport when either field is missing.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata and `slmp.__version__` to `3.0.0`.
- Docs: Replaced relative README links with absolute URLs so they resolve on package registry pages.

### BREAKING
- Library: Breaking: Removed `plc_profile_label()`. Calls written for v2.0.0 now fail immediately instead of silently changing the stored value; use `plc_profile_canonical_name()` for canonical IDs or `device_range_model_label()` to obtain the v2.0.0 return value `IQ-R`.

### Added
- Library: Added `available_plc_profiles()` for connection-selectable profile enumeration.
- Library: Added `plc_profile_canonical_name()` for canonical profile IDs.

### Docs
- Docs: Documented the distinct canonical, display-name, and device-range model-label APIs.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### BREAKING
- Release: Renamed the PyPI install package while keeping the Python import name unchanged.

| Old install name | New install name | Import name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `slmp-connect-python` | `plc-comm-slmp` | `slmp` |

- Library: Removed short `ModuleIONo` aliases in favor of the canonical module I/O vocabulary.

| Removed name | Use instead |
| --- | --- |
| `CONTROL_CPU`, `CONNECTED_CPU`, `DEFAULT` | `OWN_STATION` |
| `ACTIVE_CPU` | `CONTROL_SYSTEM_CPU` |
| `STANDBY_CPU` | `STANDBY_SYSTEM_CPU` |
| `TYPE_A_CPU` | `SYSTEM_A_CPU` |
| `TYPE_B_CPU` | `SYSTEM_B_CPU` |
| `CPU_1` to `CPU_4` | `MULTIPLE_CPU_1` to `MULTIPLE_CPU_4` |
| `SELF-CPU1` to `SELF-CPU4` | `SELF-MULTIPLE-CPU-1` to `SELF-MULTIPLE-CPU-4` |

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `2.0.0`.
- Library: Added named SLMP target module I/O constants for multi-CPU routing while keeping the default own-station target unchanged.
- Library: Synced the embedded SLMP capability fixture to `plc-comm-slmp-profiles` `v1.2.2`, including inferred Q/L 008x extended random/monitor limit keys and iQ-F `not-adopted` monitor limit placeholders.
- Docs: Added the plc-comm family package matrix link to the README and documented `ModuleIONo` values in user-facing API/routing docs.
- Tests: Added package-rename import-name coverage for `import slmp`.
- Tooling: Updated release duplicate checks to query `plc-comm-slmp`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.2.0`.
- Tooling: Normalized line-ending handling in the canonical profile JSON update script so `-SourceRoot` runs no longer report false changes.
- Library: Synced the embedded SLMP capability fixture to `plc-comm-slmp-profiles` `v1.2.1`, including `display_name` labels and Ethernet unit profiles for RJ71EN71, LJ71E71-100, and QJ71E71-100 variants.
- Library: Added `display_name(plc_profile)` as the public UI-label helper while keeping stored PLC profile values canonical.
- Docs: Documented the profile display-name helper and canonical-ID storage guidance.
- Tests: Added canonical fixture parity coverage for profile `display_name` values.
- Library: Added non-breaking SLMP specification-audit updates for manual-conformant request framing, point-limit guards, response correlation, UDP source filtering, and PLC error diagnostics.
- Library: Exposed structured PLC error information on `SlmpResponse.error_info` and `SlmpError.error_info` when a non-zero end-code response carries the 9-byte error information block.
- Library: Enforced documented point limits before transport: iQ-F direct bit access is limited to 3584 points, and 008x extended random/monitor routes use the 96-point / weighted-960 / 94-bit limits.
- Library: Connected UDP sockets before sending and receiving so datagrams from unrelated sources are not accepted as PLC responses.
- Tooling: Changed the canonical profile update script default ref from `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0`.
- Library: Added SLMP `S` step relay device-code support for reads and profile-specific write policy enforcement.
- Library: Rejected `G/HG` random bit writes; callers should use U-qualified word access for buffer-memory devices.
- Library: Aligned long counter state helper metadata so `LCS/LCC` remain long-helper entries while using their direct bit-read route internally.
- Library: Added built-in SLMP capability profiles from `plc-comm-slmp-profiles` v1.0.0 and `strict_profile=True` defaults for sync and async clients so high-level APIs reject profile `blocked` / `unverified` features before transport.
- Library: Added `SlmpProfileFeatureError` for profile guard failures with profile ID, feature key, state, evidence, and the `strict_profile=False` bypass hint.
- Library: Moved direct/random point limits to the capability table for all canonical built-in Ethernet profiles, including `melsec:qcpu` and `melsec:qnu`.
- Library: Kept the 008x extended random/monitor limits at 96 points, weighted 960, and 94 bits even when the selected profile allows larger plain random/monitor counts.
- Library: Added canonical weighted random-word write limits for `melsec:iq-l` and `melsec:iq-f`, so mixed word/dword random writes are guarded before transport.
- Library: Enforced capability write policies independently of `strict_profile`; `S` is read-only on iQ-R/iQ-L/MX/Q/L profiles and read-write on iQ-F.
- Library: Used direct write capability-limit keys for direct write requests instead of reusing direct read keys.
- Library: Rejected profile-unsupported device families before transport while leaving device address upper-bound checks to application/live-probe code.
- Library: Moved Q/L profile Read Block (`0x0406`) and Write Block (`0x1406`) rejection to the capability profile guard so `strict_profile=False` can intentionally send the request and let the PLC answer.
- Library: Batched named plain-bit reads through random word-read only for `SM/X/Y/M/L/F/V/B/SB`; `TS/TC/STS/STC/CS/CC/DX/DY` stay on direct bit reads.
- Docs: Documented profile-specific `S` write policy in supported-register, bit-device table, gotcha, audit-reflection, and maintainer difference notes.
- Docs: Documented the Q-series Read Block (`0x0406`) and Write Block (`0x1406`) profile guard in user profiles and gotchas.
- Docs: Removed the duplicated SLMP supported-register user page and linked users to the shared SLMP Profile Reference.
- Docs: Removed the per-library troubleshooting/code page; shared SLMP troubleshooting and code guidance now lives in the PLC Setup Guide.
- Docs: Added a Usage Guide example showing how to read `SlmpError.end_code` and structured `error_info`.
- Docs: Slimmed Gotchas to library-specific items and moved shared setup/end-code symptoms to the PLC Setup Guide.
- Docs: Standardized the Gotchas page structure with KV Host Link so library-specific caveats have the same destination across protocols.
- Docs: Merged bit-device packed access and extended-device access into the Usage Guide and removed the standalone user pages.
- Docs: Removed the manual page-navigation block from Getting Started and rely on site navigation instead.
- Docs: Moved shared SLMP gotcha items to the common troubleshooting page and kept Gotchas focused on Python-specific behavior.
- Docs: Added public API docstrings for the shared operation builders and a CI coverage check for public API documentation.
- Docs: Documented read-only operational recipes for multiple PLC monitoring and config-file polling.
- Docs: Fixed recent maintainer release/process and R120PCPU audit-note text issues.
- Docs: Fixed remaining PowerShell release/test command placeholders in maintainer docs.
- Docs: Cleaned up maintainer notes, obsolete probe records, and root TODO handling.
- Samples: Print `SlmpError.end_code` and structured command/subcommand details when high-level samples catch a PLC response error.
- Samples: Added read-only `multi_plc_monitor.py` and `config_polling.py` operational recipes, plus an example JSON config.
- Release: Aligned `slmp.__version__` with package metadata version `1.1.1`.
- Release: Excluded maintainer-only files, scripts, and tests from generated source archives via `.gitattributes`.
- Tooling: Changed the canonical profile update script default ref from `main` to fixed tag `v1.0.0`; `SLMP_PROFILES_REF` can still override it.
- Tests: Added guard coverage for `S` read-only writes and `G/HG` random bit write rejection.
- Tests: Added canonical capability fixture comparison plus sync and async strict-profile coverage for qnudv block/type-name guards, qnudv `strict_profile=False`, iQ-F link-direct, iQ-F `U\G`, iQ-L HG, profile limits, and profile write policies.
- Tests: Added regression coverage that profile-specific plain random/monitor limits do not relax 008x extended command limits.
- Tests: Added regression coverage that direct writes use direct write capability-limit keys.
- Tests: Updated coverage so `melsec:qcpu` and `melsec:qnu` reject block read/write through the capability profile guard.
- Tests: Added named-read planning coverage for random-word-safe plain bit families versus the direct-bit-only families seen on R-series hardware.
- Tooling: Added a release check that requires `pyproject.toml` and `slmp.__version__` to match.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.1.1`.
- Docs: Documented explicit named-address dtype requirements in existing user docs.
- Samples: Updated high-level samples to use explicit dtype suffixes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.1.0`.
- Library: Made named-address parsing and typed read/write helpers require explicit dtype suffixes such as `:U`, `:S`, `:D`, `:L`, `:F`, or `:BIT`; bare devices no longer default to `U`, `BIT`, or long-timer `D`.
- Library: Removed embedded localized SLMP end-code message text; end-code helpers now return stable code-derived keys while message lookup hooks return `None`.
- Docs: Reworked the end-code page around raw `end_code` inspection and code-derived keys instead of bundled message text.
- Tests: Updated high-level address parser tests for explicit dtype requirements.
- Tests: Updated SLMP end-code helper coverage for code-derived keys and non-embedded messages.

### Fixed
- Library: Aligned standard 008x extended device specifications with the manual 11-byte Q/L and 13-byte iQ-R layouts.
- Library: Matched 4E responses by request serial and discarded mismatched D4 responses before parsing the response payload.
- Library: Made `BIT_IN_WORD` helper addresses require an explicit bit index such as `D100.0` through `D100.F`; `D100:BIT_IN_WORD` now fails instead of silently reading or writing bit 0.
- Tests: Added coverage for rejecting `BIT_IN_WORD` addresses without an explicit bit index.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- Release: Bumped Python package metadata to `1.0.1`.
- Library: Removed the legacy `family` alias from helper-layer address parsing and formatting APIs; callers should pass `plc_profile`.
- Docs: Updated documentation so write examples restore the original PLC values after demonstration writes.
- Samples: Made sample scripts require an explicit `--plc-profile` instead of defaulting to `melsec:iq-r`.
- Samples: Updated write examples to restore the original PLC values after demonstration writes.

### Fixed
- Library: Corrected typed helper handling so boolean `BIT` writes stay on the intended bool path.
- Docs: Corrected typed helper annotations and user documentation to include boolean `BIT` reads and writes.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- Tests: Added RD device encoding coverage for `RD0` and `RD524287` in iQ-R and legacy modes.
- Tests: Added an iQ-R `read_words` frame case for `RD524286` with two points.

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.0.0` for the first stable release line.
