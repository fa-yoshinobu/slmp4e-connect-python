# iQ-R R08CPU Verification Folder

This is the main validated-target folder for the repository.

Target:

- series: `iqr`
- model: `R08CPU`
- host used in the current baseline: `192.168.250.101`
- primary ports: `TCP 1025`, `UDP 1027`

## Start Here

If you only need the current practical picture, read these first:

- [../open_items.md](../open_items.md)
  - unresolved items and current restrictions
- [pending_live_verification_latest.md](pending_live_verification_latest.md)
  - command-family live status
- [manual_label_verification_latest.md](manual_label_verification_latest.md)
  - human-confirmed label read/write/restore results
- [manual_write_verification_latest.md](manual_write_verification_latest.md)
  - human-confirmed device write/read/restore results
- [device_access_matrix.md](device_access_matrix.md)
  - current per-device snapshot from the matrix CSV

## Current Practical Snapshot

- label family is currently confirmed on real external-device-accessible labels
- remote `run`, `stop`, and `pause` are confirmed
- `1005` remote latch clear was confirmed under PLC `STOP`
- password lock/unlock is confirmed
- `0601/1601` is confirmed on the narrow CPU-buffer helper path
- `18xx` file commands remain environment-dependent and are still unresolved on this PLC
- direct `G`, `HG`, and `S` remain blocked in typed device APIs on this project

## Local-Only Artifacts

Packet captures, communication logs, and frame dumps are intentionally not tracked in Git.

If you collect them locally for debugging:

- keep them out of commits
- summarize the conclusion in a stable Markdown file instead of storing the raw artifact here

## Archive Policy

- tracked `*_latest.md` files are the current canonical outputs
- `archive/` is for timestamped history and is intentionally ignored by Git
