# Usage guide

## Recommended entry points

| Entry point | Signature | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SlmpConnectionOptions` | `SlmpConnectionOptions(host: str, plc_profile: object, port: int, transport: str, default_target: SlmpTarget, timeout: float = 3.0, monitoring_timer: int = 16, raise_on_error: bool = True)` | Store stable connection settings. Port, transport, profile, and the complete four-field route are required. |
| `open_and_connect` | `async def open_and_connect(options: SlmpConnectionOptions) -> AsyncSlmpClient` | Open one async connection. The ordinary client owns its FIFO operation queue. |
| `open_and_connect_sync` | `def open_and_connect_sync(options: SlmpConnectionOptions) -> SlmpClient` | Open one synchronous connection. |
| `plc_profile_display_name` | `def plc_profile_display_name(plc_profile) -> str` | Return the canonical human-readable PLC profile name without communication. |
| `read_typed` | `async def read_typed(client, device, dtype) -> int | float | bool` | Read one typed value. |
| `write_typed` | `async def write_typed(client, device, dtype, value: int | float | bool) -> None` | Write one typed value. |
| `read_named` | `async def read_named(client, addresses) -> dict[str, int | float | bool]` | Read a mixed named collection. |
| `write_named` | `async def write_named(client, updates) -> None` | Write one word/DWord family or one bit family in one random-write request. |
| `read_words_single_request` | `async def read_words_single_request(client, device, count) -> list[int]` | Read one contiguous 16-bit range in one request. |
| `read_bits_single_request` / `write_bits_single_request` | Async and synchronous (`*_sync`) helpers | Read or write one contiguous direct-bit range in one request. |
| `read_dwords_single_request` | `async def read_dwords_single_request(client, device, count) -> list[int]` | Read one contiguous 32-bit range in one request. |
| `write_bit_in_word` | `async def write_bit_in_word(client, device, bit_index, value) -> None` | Set or clear one bit in a word device. |
| `poll` | `async def poll(client, addresses, interval)` | Yield repeated named read results. |
| `SlmpClient.read_devices` | `read_devices(device, count, *, bit_unit)` | Generic direct read; an explicit Boolean bit/word unit is mandatory. |
| `SlmpClient.write_devices` | `write_devices(device, values, *, bit_unit)` | Generic direct write; an explicit Boolean bit/word unit is mandatory. With `bit_unit=True`, every value must be an actual `bool`; integer `0` and `1` are rejected. |
| `SlmpClient.read_devices_extended` | `read_devices_extended(qualified_device, count, *, bit_unit)` | Read routed devices such as `Un\G...` and `Jn\...`; bit/word unit is mandatory. |
| `SlmpClient.write_devices_extended` | `write_devices_extended(qualified_device, values, *, bit_unit)` | Write routed devices such as `Un\G...` and `Jn\...`; bit/word unit is mandatory. |
| `SlmpClient.read_latest_self_diagnosis_error_code` | `read_latest_self_diagnosis_error_code() -> int` | Read the raw unsigned latest self-diagnosis error code from `SD0` in one Direct Read request. |

The synchronous helpers use the same names with `_sync`.

`read_named` validates and snapshots the complete address plan before transport.
It emits exactly one canonical Random Read or rejects the plan before transport.
Oversized collections and Direct/block/long-timer routes must be split into
explicit application calls so different acquisition times and consistency
requirements remain visible.

`write_named` also has a one-request contract. Word and DWord entries may be
combined in one random-word request, or bit entries may be combined in one
random-bit request. Mixing those command families is rejected. `.n`
bit-in-word updates are rejected by `write_named`; call `write_bit_in_word`
explicitly because that helper is an intentional read-modify-write operation
consisting of one read followed by one write.

## Connection

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, SlmpTarget, open_and_connect


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        timeout=3.0,
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
        monitoring_timer=0x0010,
        raise_on_error=True,
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        print(f"connected profile={client.plc_profile}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Remote password

Remote password lock/unlock commands are available through the async and sync clients.
The Python high-level connection does not automatically unlock or lock a remote password.
If your PLC route uses remote password protection, unlock after opening the connection
and lock before closing it.
Always attempt re-lock after a confirmed unlock, including when the protected
operation fails. If unlock or re-lock has an outcome-unknown result, do not
retry automatically; reopen, inspect the PLC lock state, and reconcile it
explicitly because access may remain unlocked.

```python
async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
    await client.remote_password_unlock("secret")
    try:
        value = await read_typed(client, "D100", "U")
    finally:
        await client.remote_password_lock("secret")
```

For `C200`-series password end codes, see the shared
[SLMP Troubleshooting & Codes](https://plc-comm-docs-site.fa-labo.com/plc-setup/slmp/troubleshooting-codes/)
page.

## Routing / target station

Every connection explicitly supplies all four target fields. The own-station
values shown above are suitable only when that is the intended route. Change
them when your PLC network targets another station, CPU, or multidrop route.

`SlmpTarget` controls the SLMP destination header. It is not a device family
selector; routed devices such as `Un\Gn` and `Jn\...` still need their own
address syntax.

```python
from slmp import ModuleIONo, SlmpConnectionOptions, SlmpTarget

options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
    host="192.168.250.100",
    port=1025,
    transport="tcp",
    plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
    default_target=SlmpTarget(
        network=0x01,
        station=0x02,
        module_io=0x03FF,
        multidrop=0x00,
    ),
)
```

For a multi-CPU self target, you can also use the named module I/O helpers:

```python
target = SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=ModuleIONo.MULTIPLE_CPU_2, multidrop=0)
```

Always confirm the explicit target against the PLC routing setup.

For iQ-R multi-CPU `U3En\HG...` access, the qualified device never changes the
SLMP request target automatically. Select the destination CPU explicitly when
a write must be reflected there. A write can return a normal end code without
changing the intended CPU buffer when the selected request target identifies a
different CPU or Own Station. Cross-CPU reads remain valid. See the shared
[iQ-R target guidance](https://plc-comm-docs-site.fa-labo.com/plc-setup/slmp/iq-r/#multi-cpu-cpu-buffer-target).

## Extended device access

Use the extended-device APIs for routed device forms such as unit-buffer
`Un\G...`, CPU-buffer `U3En\G...`, CPU periodic-buffer `U3En\HG...`
(`n` is `0` through `3`), and `Jn\...`. Normal typed and named helpers
cover ordinary device families such as `D`, `M`, `X`, and `Y`.

`SlmpTarget` controls the SLMP destination header. It does not replace routed
device notation: `Un\G...` and `Jn\...` still need their own address syntax.

The public Extended Device methods derive the module/network selector,
direct-memory kind, and fixed protocol fields from the qualified address.
They do not accept a raw extension-field object. For Z, LZ, or word-device
indirect modification, wrap the qualified text in `SlmpExtendedDevice` with
`SlmpIndexZ`, `SlmpIndexLz`, or `SlmpIndirect`. Invalid combinations, such as
LZ on a Q/L access profile or an index modifier on `Jn\...`, are rejected
before transport.

### Module buffer access

Use `read_devices_extended()` and `write_devices_extended()` for intelligent module
buffer memory.

| Notation | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Un\G` | Unit buffer memory word access | `U3\G100` |
| `U3En\G` (`n = 0..3`) | CPU buffer memory word access | `U3E0\G1000` |
| `U3En\HG` (`n = 0..3`) | CPU periodic buffer memory word access | `U3E0\HG1000` |

`U3E0\HG...` through `U3E3\HG...` are valid CPU periodic-buffer forms.
`U0\HG...` and `U3E4\HG...` are invalid.

```python
from slmp import SlmpClient, SlmpTarget


with SlmpClient(
    "192.168.250.100",
    1025,
    transport="tcp",
    default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
) as client:
    original = client.read_devices_extended("U3\\G100", 4, bit_unit=False)
    write_confirmed = False
    try:
        client.write_devices_extended("U3\\G100", [1, 2, 3, 4], bit_unit=False)
        write_confirmed = True
        readback = client.read_devices_extended("U3\\G100", 4, bit_unit=False)
        print(readback)
    finally:
        if write_confirmed:
            client.write_devices_extended("U3\\G100", original, bit_unit=False)
```

`Un` is the module number in hexadecimal text, for example `U3` or `U3E0`.
Use only a configured module-buffer range reserved for controlled testing. The
example attempts to restore the original words after a confirmed write,
including when readback fails. If restoration fails, inspect and reconcile the
buffer explicitly. If the write raises `SlmpOutcomeUnknownError`, the example
deliberately does not issue another write: reopen the session, inspect the
buffer, and choose the recovery action explicitly.

Typed modification example:

```python
from slmp import SlmpExtendedDevice, SlmpIndexZ


device = SlmpExtendedDevice("U3\\D100", SlmpIndexZ(2))
values = client.read_devices_extended(device, 1, bit_unit=False)
```

Extended random-read results retain the full route:

```python
result = client.read_random_extended(word_devices=[r"U3E0\HG0", r"U3E1\HG0"])
print(result.word[r"U3E0\HG0"])
print(result.word[r"U3E1\HG0"])
```

## Monitor, self-test, and Clear Error

Monitor registration and each monitor cycle are separate one-request
operations. Supply the registered Word and DWord counts on every cycle; the
client does not auto-register, retry, or infer counts. Running a cycle before
the PLC has monitor registration sends the cycle request and returns the PLC
response or error unchanged. The combined expected count must be nonzero and
cannot exceed the selected profile's monitor-registration limit.

Monitor registration changes the PLC's active monitor set. Use only a known
device list on a controlled PLC. If registration has an outcome-unknown result,
do not register again automatically; reconnect and reconcile the monitor state
explicitly.

```python
client.register_monitor_devices(word_devices=["D120"], dword_devices=["D200"])
result = client.run_monitor_cycle(word_points=1, dword_points=1)

echo = client.self_test_loopback(b"A1B2C3D4")
```

Self-test accepts only 1–960 ASCII `0-9/A-F` bytes and requires the returned
declared length, actual length, and echo bytes to match exactly.

Clear Error is a separate state-changing maintenance action. It clears the
PLC's current error state and cannot restore the diagnostic state that existed
before the command. Capture the required diagnostics first and run it only on
a controlled PLC when clearing the error is explicitly intended:

```python
client.clear_error()
```

`clear_error` always sends the fixed command with an empty payload.

### Link direct device access

Use link direct device notation for devices on a CC-Link IE network routed
through the connected PLC.

| Access type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Word read/write | `J2\SW10`, `J1\W13` |
| Bit read/write | `J1\X10`, `J1\SB10` |

```python
from slmp import SlmpClient, SlmpOutcomeUnknownError, SlmpTarget


with SlmpClient(
    "192.168.250.100",
    1025,
    transport="tcp",
    default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
) as client:
    value = client.read_devices_extended("J2\\SW10", 1, bit_unit=False)
    bits = client.read_devices_extended("J1\\X10", 16, bit_unit=True)
    original_word = client.read_devices_extended("J1\\SW14", 1, bit_unit=False)
    original_bit = client.read_devices_extended("J1\\X11", 1, bit_unit=True)
    word_write_confirmed = False
    bit_write_confirmed = False
    outcome_unknown = False
    try:
        client.write_devices_extended("J1\\SW14", [2], bit_unit=False)
        word_write_confirmed = True
        client.write_devices_extended("J1\\X11", [True], bit_unit=True)
        bit_write_confirmed = True
        print(value, bits)
    except SlmpOutcomeUnknownError:
        outcome_unknown = True
        raise
    finally:
        if not outcome_unknown:
            if bit_write_confirmed:
                client.write_devices_extended("J1\\X11", original_bit, bit_unit=True)
            if word_write_confirmed:
                client.write_devices_extended("J1\\SW14", original_word, bit_unit=False)
```

The available link direct device families depend on the PLC route and link
module configuration. Use only link devices reserved for controlled testing.
The example attempts to restore confirmed writes in reverse order. If either
write has an unknown outcome, it stops all further writes so failed cleanup
cannot hide that result; reopen the session, inspect both link devices, and
reconcile them explicitly. If either restoration fails, stop and reconcile
both test locations manually.

Write the `J` network number with ASCII decimal digits (`0` through `9`). For
example, `J2\SW10` is valid; visually similar Unicode digits are rejected
before request construction. A `J`-qualified link-direct device always uses
the 24-bit Q/L device specification, including on an iQ-R client; other iQ-R
Extended Device entries use the 32-bit layout.

## SLMP response end codes

When the PLC returns a non-zero SLMP end code, the high-level APIs raise `SlmpError`.
Read `end_code` for the PLC response code and `error_info` when the PLC returned the structured error-information block.
When that block is present, its route, command, and subcommand must identify the
active request. A mismatch is malformed and retires the transport rather than
being published as a definitive PLC error; any bytes after the fixed prefix are
retained as additional PLC error data. Every 4E response also requires a zero
reserved field.

Successful responses from standard ACK-only APIs must contain no response data.
Unexpected data makes a possibly applied state change outcome-unknown with
reason `PROTOCOL` and retires the transport. `raw_command()` is the explicit
maintainer escape hatch and continues to return arbitrary success data.
Request-exchange deadline expiry raises `SlmpTimeoutError`, a `SlmpError` and
`TimeoutError` subclass, in both clients. The configured
`timeout` begins only after the request's FIFO turn becomes active. One absolute
deadline covers IPv4 resolution, connection and socket configuration, first
send, complete transmit, receive, route/4E-serial correlation, and response
decode; no phase or discarded response restarts it. Timeout retires the current
transport generation, so a later operation must establish a new generation and
cannot consume a late connection or response result. An explicit `connect()`
uses the same one-deadline rule from resolution through client adoption.

`SlmpClosedError`, `SlmpNotConnectedError`, and `SlmpTransportError` distinguish
local close, missing transport state, and other I/O failure. If a write, remote
control, monitor registration, password operation, or other state-changing
request may already have been sent, timeout, cancellation, close, transport, or
malformed-response failure raises `SlmpOutcomeUnknownError`. Inspect its
`reason` (`SlmpOutcomeUnknownReason`) and `cause`; do not retry blindly.
Once response correlation and command-specific decoding finish, the decoded
value, acknowledged write, or framed PLC end-code is definitive and a later
concurrent `close()` does not replace it. A read closed before that point raises
`SlmpClosedError`.

```python
from slmp import SlmpError, SlmpTimeoutError


try:
    value = await read_typed(client, "D100", "U")
    print(f"D100={value}")
except SlmpTimeoutError:
    print("SLMP request deadline expired")
except SlmpError as exc:
    if exc.end_code is not None:
        print(f"SLMP end_code=0x{exc.end_code:04X}")
    if exc.error_info is not None:
        print(f"command=0x{exc.error_info.command:04X}")
        print(f"subcommand=0x{exc.error_info.subcommand:04X}")
```

## Read a single value

| Type suffix | Meaning | Words |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `U` | Unsigned 16-bit integer | 1 |
| `S` | Signed 16-bit integer | 1 |
| `D` | Unsigned 32-bit integer | 2 |
| `L` | Signed 32-bit integer | 2 |
| `F` | IEEE-754 float32 | 2 |

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, read_typed, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        value = await read_typed(client, "D100", "U")
        print(f"D100={value}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Write a single value

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, read_typed, write_typed, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        original = await read_typed(client, "D100", "U")
        write_confirmed = False
        try:
            await write_typed(client, "D100", "U", 42)
            write_confirmed = True
            print("wrote D100")
        finally:
            if write_confirmed:
                await write_typed(client, "D100", "U", original)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Use only a register reserved for controlled testing. A confirmed write is
restored before the example exits. If the write outcome is unknown, do not
restore or retry blindly; reopen, inspect `D100`, and reconcile it explicitly.
If restoration fails, the register also requires manual reconciliation.

## Named read collection

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, read_named, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        read_result = await read_named(client, ["D100:U", "D101:S", "D200:F", "D202:L", "D50.3"])
        print(f"read_result={read_result}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Profile request limits

Batch planners can read the selected profile's canonical request limit without
opening a connection or communicating with a PLC:

```python
from slmp import SlmpProfileLimitKey, profile_limit

limit = profile_limit("melsec:qnudv", SlmpProfileLimitKey.RANDOM_READ_WORD)
if limit is not None:
    print(limit.max_points)  # 192
```

`weighted_max_points` is non-`None` only for commands, such as random
Word/DWord writes, that enforce an encoded-entry weight in addition to the point
count. The lookup returns `None` when no canonical profile/key value exists and
does not invent a family fallback.

## Block reads

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import (
    SlmpConnectionOptions,
    SlmpTarget,
    open_and_connect,
    read_dwords_single_request,
    read_words_single_request,
)


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        words = await read_words_single_request(client, "D0", 10)
        dwords = await read_dwords_single_request(client, "D200", 4)
        print(f"words={len(words)} dwords={len(dwords)}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

The canonical contiguous helpers `read_words_single_request*`,
`write_words_single_request*`, `read_dwords_single_request*`,
`write_dwords_single_request*`, `read_bits_single_request*`, and
`write_bits_single_request*` issue exactly one request or reject invalid counts
before transport. The older `read_words*`, `read_bits*`, and `write_bits*`
names, including top-level `read_dwords*`, remain only as deprecated
compatibility delegates. Top-level `read_dwords` and `read_dwords_sync` are
removed in the immediately following release; the client methods with those
names are unchanged. If multiple snapshots
are acceptable, split them explicitly in application code so their different
acquisition times remain visible.

## Packed bit-device word access

Bit-device families such as `M`, `B`, `X`, and `Y` can be read or written as
packed 16-bit word values. The device code stays the same; the command
subcommand and interpretation unit decide whether the result is one bit per
point or one packed 16-bit value.

If `M1000=1`, `M1001=0`, `M1002=1`, and `M1003=0`, the packed word beginning
at `M1000` is `0x0005`.

| Family | Bit read example | Packed word read example | Address number format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `M` | `read_named(client, ["M1000:BIT"])` | `client.read_devices("M1000", 1, bit_unit=False)` | decimal |
| `B` | `read_named(client, ["B20:BIT"])` | `client.read_devices("B20", 1, bit_unit=False)` | hexadecimal |
| `X` | `read_named(client, ["X20:BIT"])` | `client.read_devices("X20", 1, bit_unit=False)` | profile-dependent |
| `Y` | `read_named(client, ["Y20:BIT"])` | `client.read_devices("Y20", 1, bit_unit=False)` | profile-dependent |

Every semantic `DeviceRef` is bound to the exact canonical `plc_profile` used to create it. Passing it to a client configured for any other profile is rejected before request construction or transport activity, including when a unit-specific profile shares a base family with the client. Parse the address again with the destination client's profile instead of reusing it across profiles.
`DeviceRef(code, number, plc_profile)` therefore stores the profile as part of
the value, and `parse_device(text, plc_profile=...)` requires it explicitly.
A `DeviceRef` created for one profile is rejected by a client configured for a
different profile before any request is sent.

Direct devices and typed high-level expressions use separate existing APIs.
`parse_device("D100", plc_profile=...)` and `str(ref)` are the DeviceAddress
round-trip. `parse_address("D100:U", plc_profile=...)`, `D50.A`,
`format_address`, and `normalize_address` are the AddressSpec round-trip.
DeviceAddress parsing rejects dtype/bit suffixes and qualified `U...\\...` or
`J...\\...` routes; AddressSpec parsing rejects plain `D100` / `X10` and
`DeviceRef` values. Qualified routes continue to use `SlmpExtendedDevice`.
These names reuse the existing public components; there is no second set of
`parse_device_address` or `parse_address_spec` aliases.

This is especially visible for `X` and `Y`: `melsec:iq-f` uses octal text,
while the other supported profiles use hexadecimal text. For example,
`X10` means numeric address 8 for `melsec:iq-f` and numeric address 16 for
`melsec:iq-r`. Binding the profile prevents a previously parsed address from
silently changing meaning when passed to another client.

The same packed-unit rule applies when writing one word value to a bit-device
group:

```python
import asyncio

from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        original = await client.read_devices("M1000", 1, bit_unit=False)
        write_confirmed = False
        try:
            await client.write_devices("M1000", [0x0005], bit_unit=False)
            write_confirmed = True
            readback = await client.read_devices("M1000", 1, bit_unit=False)
            print(readback)
        finally:
            if write_confirmed:
                await client.write_devices("M1000", original, bit_unit=False)


asyncio.run(main())
```

This writes the packed pattern for `M1000..M1015`. Typed and named numeric
dtypes intentionally reject bit devices; use explicit low-level word-unit
direct access when packed behavior is intended. Use bit access for individual
Boolean states. Use only a 16-bit range reserved for controlled testing. An
unknown write outcome requires explicit state inspection rather than an
automatic restore or retry. A failed restoration likewise requires manual
inspection and reconciliation of the complete packed-bit range.

## Bit in word

Use `write_bit_in_word` when a PLC stores flags inside a word register. Use `.n`
notation for bit-in-word named reads; `write_named` rejects that update so the
two-request operation remains visible. `write_bit_in_word` validates and binds
its arguments before queue admission, then holds one ordinary-client FIFO turn
across its word read and word write. This prevents same-client interleaving, but
does not make the update atomic at the PLC. Another connection or PLC program
logic can change the word between requests, and the requests can run in
different PLC scans. A failure after possible write transmission is
outcome-unknown. The helper never retries automatically; verify PLC state before
issuing another update.

The same function accepts a qualified U module-buffer or J link-direct word
address (including `SlmpExtendedDevice`). The selected direct or Extended
Device route is immutable across both requests. FIFO wait is outside the
timeout; one absolute deadline covers both requests after admission. A
successful read always proceeds to the write even when the bit is unchanged.
Unsupported profile/route combinations fail before the read.

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, read_named, write_bit_in_word, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        original = await read_named(client, ["D50.3"])
        write_confirmed = False
        try:
            await write_bit_in_word(client, "D50", bit_index=3, value=True)
            write_confirmed = True
            snapshot = await read_named(client, ["D50.3"])
            print(f"D50.3={snapshot['D50.3']}")
        finally:
            if write_confirmed:
                await write_bit_in_word(client, "D50", bit_index=3, value=bool(original["D50.3"]))


asyncio.run(main())
```

If the confirmed-write restoration fails, inspect and reconcile the complete
word manually. Do not assume that the original bit value was restored.

## Polling

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, poll, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        index = 0
        async for snapshot in poll(client, ["D100:U", "D200:F", "D50.3"], interval=1.0):
            print(f"snapshot={snapshot}")
            index += 1
            if index >= 3:
                break


asyncio.run(main())
```

The address plan, compact result indexes, and immutable Random Read payload are
validated and prepared once when the polling iterator is created. Each cycle
reuses that prepared request while retaining the ordinary client FIFO,
deadline, cancellation, close, and error contracts.

## Operational recipes

The repository includes two read-only operational samples for application
shapes that come up after the first connection test.

### Multiple PLC monitoring

Use `samples/multi_plc_monitor.py` when several PLCs should be watched at the
same time. Each PLC runs in its own async task with its own connection and
reconnect loop, so one offline PLC does not block the others.

```powershell
python samples/multi_plc_monitor.py `
  --plc line-a=192.168.250.100,melsec:iq-r,1035,udp `
  --plc line-b=192.168.250.101,melsec:iq-r,1035,udp `
  --tag d100=D100:U `
  --tag temperature=D200:F `
  --cycles 3 `
  --dry-run
```

This sample only calls read helpers. For cable-pull recovery checks, prefer
UDP on the PLC-side UDP port so reconnect behavior is not delayed by TCP socket
cleanup.

### Config-file polling

Use `samples/config_polling.py` when tag lists and PLC endpoints should live
in a config file instead of Python code.

```powershell
python samples/config_polling.py --config samples/config_polling.example.json --dry-run
```

Config files are JSON by default. YAML files are accepted when `PyYAML` is
installed. CSV output is optional and uses long rows:
`timestamp,plc,tag,value`.
Remove `--dry-run` when you are ready to open PLC connections.

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "transport": "udp",
    "port": 1035,
    "timeout": 3.0,
    "interval": 1.0
  },
  "output": {
    "csv": "config_polling_output.csv"
  },
  "plcs": [
    {
      "name": "line-a",
      "host": "192.168.250.100",
      "plc_profile": "melsec:iq-r",
      "tags": [
        { "name": "d100", "address": "D100:U" },
        { "name": "temperature", "address": "D200:F" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Device range catalog

`read_device_range_catalog()` reads live device range bounds for the canonical profile selected on the client. Most bounds come from the profile's SD-register block. For QCPU, LCPU, QnU, and QnUDV base/unit profiles, it also performs the canonical runtime checks needed where SD values are insufficient: QCPU `Z15` selects a 10- or 16-point Z range, and readable `ZR` addresses are found by doubling followed by binary search (capped at 1,048,576 points). The R range is `min(ZR, 32768)`.

A nonzero PLC end code for a candidate runtime read means only that candidate is unreadable. Timeout, cancellation, transport, lifecycle, malformed-response, and local-validation failures abort the complete catalog read and propagate to the caller; no partial catalog is returned. The full SD/probe sequence owns one client FIFO turn, preventing another operation from interleaving. It does not auto-discover the PLC model.
The catalog is for diagnostics and application-layer validation. Normal read/write helpers do not use it to reject addresses by configured upper bound before sending a request.
The source rules for this catalog are maintained in the shared [SLMP device ranges](https://plc-comm-docs-site.fa-labo.com/slmp/profile-reference/device-ranges/) reference.

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        catalog = await client.read_device_range_catalog()
        entry = next(item for item in catalog.entries if item.device == "D")
        print(f"{entry.device}: {entry.address_range}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Long device families

`LTN`, `LSTN`, `LCN`, and `LZ` are 32-bit current-value families. Always request `:D` or `:L` intent when you document or review these addresses.

```python
import asyncio
from slmp import SlmpConnectionOptions, open_and_connect, read_named, SlmpTarget


async def main() -> None:
    options = SlmpConnectionOptions(
        host="192.168.250.100",
        port=1025,
        transport="tcp",
        plc_profile="melsec:iq-r",
        default_target=SlmpTarget(network=0, station=0xFF, module_io=0x03FF, multidrop=0),
    )
    async with await open_and_connect(options) as client:
        values = await read_named(client, ["LCN0:L", "LZ0:D"])
        print(f"values={values}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

> **Caution:** 16-bit word views for `LTN`, `LSTN`, `LCN`, and `LZ` are rejected. Use `:D` or `:L` for these current-value families.

## Address reference

| Form | Example | Meaning | Helper behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `:BIT` | `M1000:BIT` | Boolean bit value | One bit. |
| `:U` | `D100:U` | Unsigned 16-bit word | One word. |
| `:S` | `D100:S` | Signed 16-bit word | One word. |
| `:D` | `D200:D` | Unsigned 32-bit value | Two words, little-endian word order. |
| `:L` | `D202:L` | Signed 32-bit value | Two words, little-endian word order. |
| `:F` | `D204:F` | Float32 value | Two words, little-endian word order. |
| `.n` | `D50.3` | One bit inside a word | Hex bit index from `0` to `F`. |

Named addresses used with `read_named`, `write_named`, and `poll` must include the intended type, for example `D100:U` or `M1000:BIT`.
Empty named read, write, and polling collections are rejected. Numeric write
values must have the exact documented type and range; values are never
truncated, wrapped, parsed from strings, or converted by truthiness.

`remote_reset` returns after the complete request frame is sent and then
closes the transport. This prevents a possible reset NG response from being
mistaken for the next 3E response. Open a new connection and verify the PLC
state before continuing; the return value confirms transmission, not PLC
execution.
## Request payload limits

One SLMP request can carry at most 65,529 command-payload bytes over TCP. UDP must also fit one
complete datagram, so the command-payload maximum is 65,492 bytes for 3E and 65,488 bytes for 4E.
Array and random label requests use even-sized payloads and therefore have a largest
protocol-representable payload of 65,528 bytes before the lower UDP limit is applied.

Sync and async clients raise `ValueError` before connection, send, traffic counters, trace state,
or 4E serial allocation. Requests are never truncated. Direct, random, block,
monitor, label, memory, extend-unit, named, polling, and write operations do not
split automatically. Applications that issue several requests must define
ordering, partial-success, and write-atomicity behavior.

Operation-specific capacity is the minimum of the selected profile limit, the
command count-field range, the encoded request-payload limit, and (for reads)
the representable response size. Direct bit/word, random read/write, monitor,
and block APIs use the canonical profile limits. Memory and extend-unit APIs
validate their 16-bit length fields and encoded payload. Label APIs validate
every item plus the aggregate payload. Python response storage grows to the
validated response length; there is no caller buffer to truncate. The accepted
maximum succeeds as one request, while maximum plus one fails before send.

## Traffic statistics

Call `client.traffic_stats()` for an immutable client-lifetime snapshot of `request_count`,
`tx_bytes`, and `rx_bytes`. Complete sends and complete received frames are counted; close and
reconnect do not reset the snapshot.
